advanced smart contracts

How to participate in my ICO:
1) upload the PCdeploy.sol and PupperCoin.sol files and complile it in remix

2) instead of deploying the contract, select PupperCoinSale from the list of contracts and type 0xBD556024434dc86C0b41dE781285c224B0dE1C9e in to the "at address" box.  

3) look at the "IsOpen", "weiraised", and "cap" functions.  You can only buy coins during the ICO period, and if that is expired the IsOpen fuction should return False.  Also at the moment we can only raise a maximum of 300Eth.  check how much we have raised to date and do a quick mental subtraction to see how much we need to reach our limit, you can not invest more then that number.

4) go to the list of functions available with the deployed contract and use the "buytoken" function.  Paste your account address or the account address of whoever you want to get the coins into the field and enter how much you want to invest in the Value field (do not exceed the we still need to raise), and hit transact.  

5) if you type beneficiary's account address into the balance file, you will see how many tockens are their.

6) Once the time period for the ICO has expired, and the raise has been finalized, you can now trade your tokens

7) I have 18 decimals on the coin which is named CorgiCoin with a symbol of CRGI.  The address for the coin is 0x3709950e24aaCC593efc43dB670D63be5d6EDDe7

8) to look the tokens up on Mywallet, Click "scan for tokens"  When nothing comes up, click "add custome token"

9) past the address for the token, the token symbol, and the decimal into the fields and click save.
